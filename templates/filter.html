	<h3> Filters </h3>
	<ul> <li>Filters provide a way to format the data we display to the user.</li> <li>Filters can be used in HTML file by using the '|' pipe or in javascript file by $filter service. </li>
	<li>To pass an argument to a filter in HTML file, use colon sign ':' after the filter name. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	For instance, letâ€™s say we want to capitalize our string. We can either change all the characters in a string to be capitalized, or we can use a filter.

	<pre>
		&lt;div&gt; {{name | uppercase} &lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>

	We can also use filters from within JavaScript by using the $filter service. For instance, to use the lowercase JavaScript filter:

	<pre>
	app.controller('DemoController', ['$scope', '$filter',
		function($scope, $filter) {
			$scope.name = $filter('lowercase')('Ari');
		}
	]);
	</pre>
	<ul>
	There are few in-built filters available:
	<li> Currency </li>
	The currency filter formats a number as currency. In other words, 123 as currency looks like:
	<pre>
		 &lt;div&gt; {{ 123 | currency } &lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
		Currency gives us the option of displaying a currency symbol or identifier. The default currency
		option is that of the current locale; however, we can pass in a currency to display
	<br> <li> Date </li>
		The date filter allows us to format a date based upon a requested format style. The date formatter
		provides us several built-in options.
	<br><li> Function </li> Runs a function on the data and returns a non falsy output. It will run the function over each element of the array, and the results that return as non-falsy will
	appear in the new array. For instance, selecting all of the words that have the letter e in them, we could run our filter like so:
	<pre>
		 &lt;div&gt;{{ ['Ari', 'Lerner', 'Likes', 'To', 'Eat', 'Pizza'] | filter:'e' } &lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	Output: ["Lerner","Likes","Eat"]

	<br> <li> JSON </li> It takes javascript object and returns a string
		The json filter will take a JSON, or JavaScript object, and turn it into a string. This transformation
		is very useful for debugging purposes:
		<pre>
		 &lt;div&gt;{{ {'name': 'Ari', 'City': 'San Francisco'} | json } &lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>	
	<br><li> Number </li>
	<br><li> String </li>

	It will accept all elements that match against the string. If we want all the elements that do not match the string, we can prepend a ! to the string.

	<br><li> Object </li>
	Compares the properties of the objects. It will compare objects that have a property name that matches, as with the simple substring match if only a string is passed in. If we want to match against all properties, we can use the $ as the key.
	</ul>
	
	You can also specify custom filters by first creating a module and then calling filter() method on the module object.
